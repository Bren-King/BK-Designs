       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <img src=".\0011.jpg" alt="family photo" id="family">
         <p>Brenda King Designs is actually a class project for Codecademy. This is my first website from scratch.
        I am really excited how it is going so far. As a marketing consultant, have done interior design back in 2009-2010 for model 
        homes and sales offices. I am an experienced artist with graphic art that has been published in magazines. My new form of 
        art is webdesign. Professionally, I am an Accountant but, my creative side has been neglected. I am looking for a career change!
